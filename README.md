As part of a 2023 IoT class project, this innovative device was designed to provide real-time environmental monitoring. Built using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Python programming, it incorporates multiple sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and pressure. Key features include a gyroscope for orientation, an accelerometer for detecting speed changes, a magnetometer for Earthâ€™s magnetic field orientation, a barometric pressure sensor for altitude estimation and short-term weather forecasting, and a humidity sensor for measuring air moisture. The device tracks and analyzes these parameters over time, offering clear graphical visualizations for better data interpretation. Designed with user utility in mind, this compact tool showcases how IoT technology can address everyday needs and provide valuable insights. This project highlights a practical application of IoT principles while delivering a marketable, functional solution for environmental analysis and monitoring.
